# Problem Statement

A bank issues many credit cards. Each credit card has a credit card no. It has a list of purchases associated with it. Every purchase made using the credit card has a date of purchase, amount of purchase and pay back points for that purchase. The credit card has the total payback points accumulated across all the purchases made. The policy for adding the payback points for every purchase is as follows 

Sr No
Amount of Purchase
Pay back points
1
Up To 10000.00 
1 point for every 200 Rs purchase
2
From 10001.00 to 15000.00
1 point for every 150 Rs purchase
3
From 15001.00 to 20000.00
1 point for every 100 Rs purchase
4
From 20001.00 onwards 
1 point for every 80 Rs purchase


Create 4 credit cards with 5, 6, 7, 8 purchases each. Let the purchase amount vary from 10000.00 to 25000.00.
Finally show the total payback points for every credit card.
