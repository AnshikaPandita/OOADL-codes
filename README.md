# Problem Statement

A complex number is represented as real part and imaginary part for eg C1(realPart , imagPart).
 One can calculate its magnitude as addition of realPart square, imaginary part square and taking its square root. 
One can calculate its argument(angle) as tan inverse of the imaginary part by realPart.
 The magnitude can be displayed. The angle can be displayed. Its conjugate can be calculated and it will be displayed. 
Two complex numbers can be added to get a complex number and it will be displayed. 
Two  complex numbers can be subtracted to get a complex number and it will be displayed. 
Represent the above description as an interface and implementing class and implement the description in java  


C1 = 5+4i			C3 = 3+4i
C2 = 1-1i			C4 = 2+3i
