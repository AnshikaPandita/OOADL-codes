# Problem Statement 
A polynomial appears as
3x4+7x3−8x2−10x1−6x0	
This is polynomial with degree n. It has a coefficient of each term. So, it can be looked at as a combination of several terms each having a degree and a coefficient.
Once the polynomial is modeled it can be evaluated for a value of a variable x. It can be added to another polynomial which results in a polynomial. The polynomial can be subtracted from another polynomial which results in a polynomial. 
Model this polynomial with an appropriate data structure. Identify its attributes. Identify its behavior. Represent this as a class diagram.  
Convert to class diagram into a code in java
